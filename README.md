# Common Java Project

I found that I'd been fighting with configuring common elements of many Java projects I created - setting up Maven and Log4J.  I wanted to create a common stub of a Java project that I could quickly reuse for other projects.

This will contain:

* Configured Maven shade-plugin enabled project
* Configured Log4J (with YAML support)
* Guava
* Common Apache tools
* Pico CLI
* Ability to load a configuration file
